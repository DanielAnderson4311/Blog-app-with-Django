!! - settings.py has been hidden to keep my device safe as it contains passwords

1 - Created a virtual environment for Django and mysqlclient, connected Django to MySql, created and migrated an inital model (posts and comments), some templates created and linked to a url / view but remain empty for now
2 - Started to make some of the HTML pages' content (mainly only index.html which can then be copied as needed to others), made the basic functionality for posts to be added to the database automatically. Next week(s), to add functionality that allows users to control and view posts in the browser and to allow for authentication.
